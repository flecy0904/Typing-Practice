The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Never underestimate the power of a good book.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
The early bird catches the worm.
Actions speak louder than words.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
All that glitters is not gold.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Fortune favors the bold.
Honesty is the best policy.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Knowledge is power.
Practice makes perfect.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
There is no place like home.
Time is money.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
